  <h1>Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search for Rummikub Variant</h1>

  <h2>Abstract:</h2>
  <p>
    Dummykub is a variant of Rummikub, a turn-based game of imperfect information played by 2-4 people. The game state
    consists of the playersâ€™ hands, private to each player, the board, the public tiles previously played, and the pool of
    unknown tiles. There are 2 sets of tiles numbered from 1 to 7 and in three different colors: red, blue, and yellow.
    Players are initially dealt a hand of 8 random tiles from the pool. Players play sets, which can be either a run, a set
    of three or more consecutive, strictly increasing, numbers all in the same color or a group, is a set of three of the
    same number in uniquely different colors. I will be implementing an IS-MCTS agent. IS-MCTS is an algorithm similar to
    MCTS, an heuristic algorithm that builds a search tree and expands the tree while focusing on promising branches to find
    more favorable outcomes; but IS-MCTS uses information sets instead of game states. Information sets are simply sets of
    states that are indistinguishable from one player's point of view, due to the hidden nature of their opponent's state. I
    initially started with Monte Carlo CFR (MCCFR) but changed to IS-MCTS after struggling with the large action state. A
    low amount of games were used and so results varied, but IS-MCTS achieved anywhere from a 70% to an 80% win rate, over a
    range of exploration values, against a random agent, between 50% to a 60% win rate against a greedy agent. This clearly
    shows that IS-MCTS performs much better than a random agent, and still better than an impressive greedy agent.
